Based on: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13656699/update-r-using-rstudio](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13656699/update-r-using-rstudio)

* Step 1: update R
* Step 2: update RStudio
* Step 3: move the packages from the old R installation into the new version
    + From: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/X.XX/Resources/library
    + To: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/X.XX/Resources/library

* Step 4: update your packages by typing update.packages() in your RStudio console, and answering 'y' to all of the prompts.
* Step 5: check 

```
version
packageStatus()
```

* Problem with SSH/HTTPS remote URL
    + Check remote URL
    
```
git remote -v
```    

    
    + Change remote URL to SSH URL ([https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/)):
    
```
git remote set-url origin <new URL>
```
